- PayPal (recommended worldwide/mobile/browser):

  [![Donate via PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/PayPal-Donate-009cde?logo=paypal&logoColor=white)](https://paypal.me/gillsystems)

  Link: `https://paypal.me/gillsystems` — this is your PayPal.Me link. If you prefer PayPal's hosted Donate button link, you can instead use a URL like `https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=XXXXXXXX` (created from PayPal Buttons).

- Venmo (US/mobile-friendly):

  [![Donate via Venmo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Venmo-Donate-3d95ce?logo=venmo&logoColor=white)](https://venmo.com/Stephen-Gill-007)

  Link: `https://venmo.com/Stephen-Gill-007` — your Venmo profile link. Note: Venmo is primarily mobile/US-focused.

Quick instructions: where to find/copy your links

- PayPal.Me (simple link):
  1. Log in to payPal.com.
  2. Click your profile (top-right) and look for "PayPal.Me" (or visit https://www.paypal.com/paypalme if available).
  3. Create or copy your PayPal.Me username. The link format is `https://paypal.me/YourUsername`.
     - Your PayPal.Me link (filled in this template): `https://paypal.me/gillsystems`.

- PayPal Donate button (hosted link):
  1. Log in to payPal.com and open "All Tools" (or "PayPal Buttons").
  2. Create a new "Donate" button and follow the steps.
  3. Copy the hosted donate link (it looks like `https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=XXXXXXXX`).

- Venmo profile link (web/mobile):
  1. In the Venmo mobile app, open your profile and use the share/profile link option to copy the URL, or on the web visit `https://venmo.com/YourUsername`.
  2. If you want a mobile-only deep link (for apps), use `venmo://paycharge?txn=pay&recipients=YourUsername`, but note this works only if the user has the Venmo app.
  - Your Venmo profile link (filled in this template): `https://venmo.com/Stephen-Gill-007`.

Notes, recommendations, and edge cases

- Include both PayPal and Venmo if you have both — PayPal reaches more countries and non-mobile users; Venmo is convenient for US mobile users and friends.
- PayPal fees apply to received payments depending on account type; donations from PayPal.Me may still be subject to fees unless configured otherwise.
- If you use a private Venmo profile, users may not be able to send payments; consider setting payments to public/allow non-friends if appropriate.
- If you're not comfortable showing a username, use PayPal's hosted "Donate" button which gives a hosted URL (and sometimes allows charity/nonprofit settings).
- QR codes: if you want a QR image for the link, you can use a free QR API, for example: `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=https://paypal.me/YOUR_PAYPALME_USERNAME`.

Where to put the snippet in a README

- Common places: top-level next to other badges (under the project title) or in a `Support` or `Contributing` section.
- Keep wording short and friendly, and avoid asking for money repeatedly.

Privacy / legal note

- Do not solicit payments you can't deliver on (deliverables/pledges). If you accept donations as a business or charity, ensure you comply with local tax and disclosure rules.

Replacement checklist (what to edit in the template before copying):
- Change `YOUR_PAYPALME_USERNAME` to your PayPal.Me username (or swap to the hosted donate link).
- Change `YOUR_VENMO_USERNAME` to your Venmo username.
- Optional: change badge colors or text to match your README style.

If you want, I can:
- Insert this snippet automatically into all README files in this repo (in a preferred place).
- Generate and save QR-code PNGs for the links into the repo.
